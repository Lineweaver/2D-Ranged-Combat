# 2D-Ranged-Combat
A basic prototype of a character controller for a rouge-like game, made in Unity. The player can move with the WASD keys and aim and shoot with the mouse. There are also two types of enemies included: one that chases the player, and one that tries to shoot it. Art is made with free sprites found in OpenGameArt.org .
